     * In other words you can say that only a single copy of static variable is created and shared among all the instances of the class.
     * Memory allocation for such variables only happens once when the class is loaded in the memory. (
     * i.e. create one driver instance means that will only shared across lifecycle of the framework)

     * then this webdriver is going to send multiple request to the selenium server so that it can open multiple browser to start multple test parallel
